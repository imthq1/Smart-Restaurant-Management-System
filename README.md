# QROrder Microservices Ecosystem

A high-performance, event-driven Microservices system designed for modern smart restaurants. This application enables customers to scan a **table-specific QR code** to browse the menu and place orders, with **real-time updates** on their order status.

*Overview of the microservices ecosystem and inter-service communication.*

## System Architecture

The project leverages a cloud-native architecture for high availability and instant responsiveness:

* **API Gateway:** Centralized entry point for routing and load balancing.
* **Service Discovery (Eureka):** Dynamic registration and discovery of microservices.
* **Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka):** De-couples `Order Service` and `Kitchen Service` for reliable message processing.
* **Real-time Updates (WebSocket):** Provides instant notifications to both customers (order status) and staff (new orders) without page reloads.

## Customer Experience (Mobile Client)

When a customer scans the QR code at their table, they are directed to a seamless web-based ordering interface.

## Management Dashboards (Admin & Staff)

The administrative suite provides total control over restaurant operations with a real-time, responsive interface.

### Kitchen Monitor (Real-time)
Designed for chefs to manage the cooking queue. Orders appear instantly as they are placed by customers.

- **Status Tracking:** Mark orders as "Xong" (Done) or "Hủy" (Cancel).
- **Live Sync:** Instant updates across all kitchen displays via **WebSocket**.

### Table & Order Management
A birds-eye view of the restaurant floor and active transactions.

| *Real-time occupancy and table status.* | *Detailed breakdown of items, notes, and payments.* |

### Internal Scheduling (Calendar Service)
Centralized planning for restaurant activities.

## Microservices Overview

| Service | Primary Responsibility | Tech/Storage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity Service** | JWT Authentication & User Sessions. | MySQL |
| **Menu Service** | Digital Menu & **Table/QR Code Management**. | MySQL |
| **Order Service** | Transactional logic and order lifecycle. | MySQL |
| **Kitchen Service** | Order preparation workflow & Chef UI. | MySQL, WebSocket |
| **Calendar Service** | Staff scheduling & Inventory audit logs. | MySQL |
| **User Service** | Customer loyalty and profile management. | MySQL |

## The Real-Time Workflow

1.  **Scan & Browse:** Customer scans the QR code (`table_id` encoded).
2.  **Order Placement:** `Order Service` saves the order and produces a message to **Kafka**.
3.  **Kitchen Notification:** `Kitchen Service` consumes the Kafka message and pushes a **WebSocket** alert to the Chef's dashboard.
4.  **Status Update:** When the Chef clicks "Prepared", the `Kitchen Service` sends a **WebSocket** notification back to the specific Customer's device.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Java Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Gateway, Eureka).
* **Real-time:** **Spring WebSocket (STOMP)**.
* **Messaging:** **Apache Kafka** (Asynchronous events).
* **Database:** MySQL.
* **Build Tool:** Maven.
